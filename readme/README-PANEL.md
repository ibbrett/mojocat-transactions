## Tech Assignment 

### Overall 

- The task was to implement a view of transactions and a modal for transaction details.
- The data form was retrieved from an API endpoint, a simple GET, using fetch would suffice

### Day 1

- I created a table displaying certain fields form the data retrieved 
- I created a modal for more detailed information
- I created a Loading/Spinner component to display while waiting for fetch to complete

### Day 2

- I created filters, updated endpoints for top merchants and categories
- I added a dropdown to allow the user to select the different options

### Day 3 

- performance considerations: caching, smallest payload structure to return all needed data, handling request loads with things like Kubernetes
- privay considerations: lock down the API to only allow authenticated users with the granted level of authorization to view this data 
- security considerations: implement AWS Security Infrastructure Cognito and JWTs, for example. AWS handles encryption

- AWS Identity and Access Management is used more for managing identities and access to AWS services and resources
